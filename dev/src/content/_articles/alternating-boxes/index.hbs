    <h1>Alternating boxes</h1>
    <h2>Complex / Simple </h2>

    <p>After a very brief discussing about a layout with one of my designer colleagues I started to have a look at how it could actually be made. It turned out it was a bit harder than it first sounded.</p>

    <p>The initial concept was straight forward â€“ an alternating grid of sections in a checker board layout. On small screens the sections would stack one on top of the other and as screen sizes get bigger the sections should align side by side in grid.</p>

    This sounded to me like a job for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes" rel="external">flexbox layout</a>.

    <p>I Started out, as always, with clean semantic markup. This is just as series of sections. Notice there are no presentational classes.</p>
